Mood will allow your cloud-users to socially share their mood. It will add an header to the Activity App.

This app will need:
- Nextcloud 12
- [Circles](https://github.com/nextcloud/circles) (from the app store)
- [Activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/activity) (from the app store)


**Mood is beta. This project is mostly here to test Circles' API.**
