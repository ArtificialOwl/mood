**Share your mood.**

Mood will allow your cloud-users to socially share their mood. It will add an header to the Activity App.

This app will need:
- Nextcloud 12
- [https://github.com/nextcloud/circles](Circles) (from the app store)
- [https://github.com/nextcloud/activity](Activity) (from the app store)


**Mood is PRE-ALPHA. This project is mostly here to test Circles' API.**
